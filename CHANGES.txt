Unreleased
----------

Feature
~~~~~~~

- Add Request.remote_host, exposing REMOTE_HOST environment variable.

- Added ``acceptparse.Accept.parse_offer`` to codify what types of offers
  are compatible with ``acceptparse.AcceptValidHeader.acceptable_offers``,
  ``acceptparse.AcceptMissingHeader.acceptable_offers``, and
  ``acceptparse.AcceptInvalidHeader.acceptable_offers``.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/376

Bugfix
~~~~~~

- SameSite may now be passed as str or bytes to `Response.set_cookie` and
  `cookies.make_cookie`. This was an oversight as all other arguments would be
  correctly coerced before being serialized. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/361 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/362

- acceptparse.MIMEAccept which is deprecated in WebOb 1.8.0 made a backwards
  incompatible change that led to it raising on an invalid Accept header. This
  behaviour has now been reversed, as well as some other fixes to allow
  MIMEAccept to behave more like the old version. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/356

- ``acceptparse.AcceptValidHeader``, ``acceptparse.AcceptInvalidHeader``, and
  ``acceptparse.AcceptNoHeader`` will now always ignore offers that do not
  match the required media type grammar when calling ``.acceptable_offers()``.
  Previous versions raised a ``ValueError`` for invalid offers in
  ``AcceptValidHeader`` and returned them as acceptable in the others.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/372
