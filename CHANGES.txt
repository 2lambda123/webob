Experimental Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These features are experimental and may change at any point in the future.

- The cookie API's now have the ability to set the SameSite attribute in both
  webob.cookies.make_cookie and webob.cookies.CookieProfile.

Bugfix
~~~~~~

- Allow unnamed fields in form data to be properly transcoded when calling
  request.decode with an alternate encoding. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/309

- ``Response.__init__`` would discard ``app_iter`` when a ``Response`` had no
  body, this would cause issues when ``app_iter`` was an object that was tied
  to the life-cycle of a web application and had to be properly closed.
  ``app_iter`` is more advanced API for ``Response`` and thus even if it
  contains a body and is thus against the HTTP RFC's, we should let the users
  shoot themselves by returning a body. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/305
