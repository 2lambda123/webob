Bugfix
~~~~~~

- acceptparse.MIMEAccept which is deprecated in WebOb 1.8.0 made a backwards
  incompatible change that led to it raising on an invalid Accept header. This
  behaviour has now been reversed, as well as some other fixes to allow
  MIMEAccept to behave more like the old version. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/356
